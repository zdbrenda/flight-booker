# Flight Booker (A web application to allow users to search and book flights)

This project is a part of the curriculum of the Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/). I use it to mainly practice my Ruby on Rails Skills and create web applications using Ruby on Rails.

The detailed description of the project is: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/flight-booker

I have deployed the project to heroku: https://obscure-hollows-92689.herokuapp.com/

## Implemented Features:

So far, I have implemented the following features:

1. Seed database from populating IATA airport codes downloaded from online
2. Allow user to select departure airport, arrival airport, number of passengers, and departure date to search for a flight
3. Allow user to enter their passenger information when booking the flight
4. Once flight booking is completed, users will receive a confirmation email in the email addresses they entered during booking
5. Deployed to Heroku, with SendGrid utilized to send confirmation emails in production

## Issues to work on

1. Clicking the radio button on search result page won't do anything.
2. Users can print the travel itinerary after booking is finished.
3. Billing and payment procedure.
